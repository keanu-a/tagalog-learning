## Inspiration

One of my goals for the 2023 year is to learn Tagalog. As a Filipino, I never got taught how to speak Tagalog from my family, but finally thought it was time to.
As a Computer Science major, I thought it could be a great idea to incorporate both skills in learning the language and coding to create a website that teaches
tagalog.
